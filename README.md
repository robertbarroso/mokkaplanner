## Features

Add the games and content that you'll be streaming to the schedule along with the summary of your stream, time, and day. 

### Modify the design
Change the color of elements in your schedule to fit your channels color scheme. 

### Upload your own image
Have art you'd like to add to the schedule to the left, with a section at the bottom for crediting the artist! Or, leave it white to have an image be added later in your editing software of choice.
